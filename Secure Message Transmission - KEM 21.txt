Assessment Task: Secure Message Transmission

You are tasked with developing a secure messaging application that ensures confidentiality and integrity of messages exchanged between users. The application should use a Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) with symmetric key encryption for secure message transmission.

Requirements:

Implement a Java program that simulates a messaging system between two users. Each user should have a unique identifier (e.g., username).
Use a Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) to securely exchange a symmetric key between the sender and the receiver for encrypting and decrypting messages.
The sender should encrypt the message using the shared symmetric key before transmitting it to the receiver.
The receiver should decrypt the received message using the shared symmetric key.
Ensure that the application handles exceptions appropriately, including encryption/decryption failures and invalid user interactions.
